## Description
This is my project task I've been making during the Udacity Website Performance optimization course.

I've decided not to customize this portfolio yet to make it easier by reviewer to check optimizations made and evaluate my work. 

The list of optimizations made by me is __[here](frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/List of optimizations.md)__:
